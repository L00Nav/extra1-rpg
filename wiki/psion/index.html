        <h3>An unshackled solar</h3>
        <p>
            <i>Shackled down and defamed by tales of god-king's tyrany. Cast out of all social circles, like the dead god of justice in the sky that they're named after. The solars have endured for long enough. Does power corrupt or does it allow the corrupt to show their true colours? What would the self-proclaimed weak do if their minds could warp reality?</i>

            The psion is one of the solars - unimaginably powerful sorcerers, shackled down to a human level - whose collar is cracking. The gaps in your restraints determine the amount of reality bending power you can unleash. Mind your output, however, for a conjured forcefield is all the stands between a foe's weapon and your flesh.
