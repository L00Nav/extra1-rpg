            <i>Those who claim birthright fail, time and time again, to prove themselves worthy. In war, you need the certainty of steel and the ingenuity of mind. It's high time the irrelevant traditions were put to rest, like how a true knight puts down the creatures that threaten mankind.</i>

            The engineer is an ingenious craftsman who fights using a set of power armour. This set consists of a number of mechanical parts - each has its main use and a powerful effect when overloaded, putting it out of commission for the rest of the fight. Manage your resources carefully and you might prevail.
