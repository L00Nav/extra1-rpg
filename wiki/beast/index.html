        <h1>The Beast</h1>
        <h3>An inhuman outcast</h3>
        <p>
            <i>Under the protection of Lady Luna, the star gods and the kingdom, there live the humans. Outside the borders of civilization, in the dark corners of the wilds, there lurk the cursed creatures. A simple distinction, more clear-cut than reality. Some beasts prefer looking and living like humans. Some aren't as fortunate.</i>

        <h2>Playstyle</h2>
        <p>
            The beast is a young adult cast out from society, as their monstrous ancestry manifested itself. Cast out into the wilds, they're forced to fight the other bests out there, along the one threatening their sanity. Be careful, for some tools migth win you one fight, but lose another.
