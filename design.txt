Initial descriptiom:

The game should be a linear RPG
    -The gameplay consists exclusively of a generous handful of fights
        No tech trees, no exploration, etc.
    -There's three classes the player can pick from, that have RPG-maker / early FF / monmusu quest style combat.
        Character progression is linear. The puzzle is to figure out how to use existing tools.
    
    The three classes are: engineer, beast, psion
        Engineer's critical resource is his gear. It performs decently, but you can overcharge it for a great effect, losing it for the rest of the fight
        Beast's critical resource is his health. They have superhuman powers that cost health and, if managed properly, heal them through violence
        Psion's critical resource is their focus. It's used for fantastic spells, but you'll struggle to have enough. Replenishes actively and passively.



Before anything else tho, let's figure out basic functionality:
    Displaying images on canvas
    UI
    Controls
    Combat
    Saving results of each battle
